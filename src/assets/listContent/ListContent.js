    longDescription:
      "Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal  and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of 2019, over 300 people have died on Everest, many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.",

The peak has now been climbed by almost all of its ridges. Although the summit of Everest is at a higher altitude, K2 is a more difficult and dangerous climb, due in part to its more inclement weather. As of February 2021, only 377 people have completed the ascent to its summit. There have been 91 deaths during attempted climbs, according to the list maintained on the list of deaths on eight-thousanders.",

After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third highest mountain.",

Everest gets all the attention while Lhotse, though often considered more visually attractive, is significantly less busy. While the main summit of Lhotse was first climbed in 1956, the Lhotse Middle actually remained the highest unclimbed, named point on Earth for decades. It was eventually first scaled in 2011 by a Russian expedition.",

Their ascent was most notable for the fact that a full ten members of the expedition team summited the mountain on the trip. In those days, it was normally only one or two climbers from each team who reached the top of the mountain on an expedition, so this was a huge deal at the time, and generally, it's just quite nice, isn't it? The first two summited on 15 May 1955, then four more went up the next day, then four more went up the day after that. Just very wholesome mountain climbing, really.",

That’s not to say scaling this massive mountain isn't dangerous, however; Cho Oyu has still claimed the lives of at least 52 people since 1952.",

Similar to Everest, the summit of Dhaulagiri is composed of limestone and dolomite rock layers that originally formed at the bottom of the ocean hundreds of millions of years ago and were pushed up by powerful tectonic forces.",

On the other side of Dhaulagiri, across the Kali River gorge in Nepal, Annapurna is perhaps the most deadly mountain in the world. In 1950, Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal were the first to reach the summit (losing their toes and fingers to frostbite as a result), marking the first of the Earth's 14 eight-thousanders to be scaled. A documentary of the expedition was made, called Victoire sur l'Annapurna. Its summit was the highest summit attained for three years, until the first successful ascent of Mount Everest had already been attained on Everest in the 1920s. Another successful climb wasn't achieved until 20 years later.",
